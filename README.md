# Learner Projects 
Public Repository to contain all mini-projects and assignments related to languages being learned. Projects added are not copies of the referenced material and instead are self-implementations unless otherwise specified. Larger projects that require dedicated directory organization will have separate repositories.

Repository serves as accessible reference to completed projects.

Owned and maintained by [@opullum](https://github.com/opullum).
